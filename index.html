    <h3>Unite Students</h3>
      <div class="company-description-modal">
        <p>One of the UK’s largest student accommodation providers, Unite have more than 50,000 beds across the UK including 10,124 beds in London.</p>
        <p>As of February 23 2016, Rents in Unite’s 27 London halls start at £149 per week for a room in North Lodge, Tottenham Hale, and go up to £373 per week  for a studio flat in Kirby Street, Farringdon.</p>
        <p>None of their London rooms (as currently advertised) meet the affordability criteria set out by the NUS. Affordability is calculated as rooms costing less than 50% of the maximum available student loan.</p>
        <p>The company has come under fire from housing activists for their prices, including a flash occupation of their Holborn offices in October 2016.</p>
        <p>A spokesperson said: “We recognise that there is concern about the rising cost of a university education and accommodation, and that affordability is an issue for many students.</p>
        <p>“In setting our rents, we work closely with university accommodation departments, and we are constantly looking at ways to provide a better student life experience as affordably as possible.”</p>
        <p>A document from 2012 seen by London Student set out their intention to expand in London faster than elsewhere, as the capital’s high levels of housing demand, higher rents and large international student population offers high profitability.</p>
        <p>In the same document Unite present Unite Capital Cities, a joint venture with the Government of Singapore which holds more than £385m worth of property in London and Edinburgh. Under the name London Student Accommodation Venture, the same partnership intended to invest a further £330m in London properties.</p>
        <p>Despite opposition from student campaigns, their stake in the housing market <a href="http://www.unite-group.co.uk/sites/default/files/2017-02/2016-Preliminary-Results-Presentation.pdf">continues to grow</a>, as they open more halls and enter into nominational agreements with universities - a form of outsourcing where the university pays Unite to reserve spaces for their students.</p>
        <p>UCL reserves spaces in Unite St Pancras Way for its students, where residents have <a href="http://www.hallbookers.co.uk/halls/441/st-pancras-way-london.html">complained</a> of infrequent cleaning services and even mice problems.</p>
